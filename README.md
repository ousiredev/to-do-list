> **NOTE:** This text is AI-generated, but the **code is written by me** (I was too lazy to f*cking write the README.md myself 😅)

A simple **command-line To-Do List app** written in Python.  
It allows users to **add**, **remove**, and **view** their tasks in a simple text-based interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks  
- ❌ Remove existing tasks  
- 📋 Display all current tasks  
- 👋 Exit the program safely

## 🧠 How It Works

The program runs in a **loop** that keeps showing a menu until the user chooses to quit.

### Menu Options:
1️⃣ **Add Task** – Type a new task to add it to your list.  
2️⃣ **Remove Task** – Type the exact name of a task to delete it.  
3️⃣ **Show Tasks** – Displays all your current tasks.  
4️⃣ **Quit** – Exits the program.
